## To get things started

Make sure that you have:
- `docker` setup in your local machine
- `docker-compose` setup in your local machine

then you can start the containers using: `docker-compose up`

## References
- the docker scaffolding is directly from [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/django/)
